            blockquote(cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chit_fund").
              A chit fund is a type of rotating savings and credit association system.
              Chit fund schemes may be organized by financial institutions, or informally among friends, relatives, or neighbours.
              In some variations of chit funds, the savings are for a specific purpose. Chit funds are often microfinance organizations.
